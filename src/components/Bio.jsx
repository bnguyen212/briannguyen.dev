        I graduated from the <a className="url" href="//www.upenn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong></a> with a BA in Economics and Linguistics.
        I previously worked in IT Support and EB-5 Investor Relations before switching to Software Development.
        My journey as a developer began in 2018 after an immersive semester of software engineering at the <strong>Horizons School of Technology</strong>, where I also worked as the Junior Instructor for the summer cohorts.
        I currently work at <strong>Make School</strong>, a 21st century college for applied computer science, to support instructors and students in the frontend & backend web development tracks. Via this opportunity I get work with emerging developers of various background on so many awesome projects using many different frameworks and libraries.

        As a software developer, I aspire to build sustainable products that increase human productivity and facilitate personal and/or collective growth.
        I am especially fond of apps that make people's live easier, hence my two favorites are <a className="url" href="//1password.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>1Password</strong></a> and <a className="url" href="//www.grammarly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Grammarly</strong></a>. A few of the most exciting projects I have worked on are definitely ones I still use frequently afterward, be sure to <strong>check out my Chrome extension JobMate below</strong>!
        My friends describe me as a 5-year-old at heart, always curious and desires to learn something new everyday.
        A lot of my free time lately is spent on Udemy sharpening my skills and keeping up with the tech industry's latest developments.
        Letâ€™s chat if you share any of my interests listed below and/or have a project idea you would like to collaborate on (extra kudos if you want to discuss that over boba tea)!
